"""Cross-platform test resource ownership helpers.

Windows does not permit deleting an SQLite database while a connection still
owns a file handle. A number of legacy unittest-style tests register N0TE
memory/store ``close`` callbacks with ``addCleanup`` but delete their temporary
profile tree in ``tearDown``. unittest normally runs registered cleanups after
``tearDown``, which POSIX tolerated and Windows correctly rejects.

Keep production connection semantics unchanged. On Windows only, run the
registered N0TE SQLite-owner close callbacks immediately before unittest calls
``tearDown``. All unrelated cleanup callbacks remain registered and preserve
normal unittest ordering.
